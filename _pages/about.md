I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University**.

My research lies at the intersection of **applied probability**, **stochastic processes**, and **machine learning**, with a focus on **mathematical modeling of biological systems**. I am particularly interested in developing **probabilistic and dynamical models** for stochastic gene regulation and biochemical reaction networks.

Methodologically, I work with tools from **probability theory**, **stochastic processes**, **dynamical systems**, and **numerical computation**, and integrate them with **neural network–based inference methods**. My recent work explores how **generative models** and **optimal transport–based frameworks** can be used to characterize stochastic dynamics and perform parameter inference from **single-cell data**.

My current research topics include:
- Stochastic gene regulatory networks
- Mathematical modeling of biochemical reaction systems
- Generative modeling and optimal transport for single-cell dynamics
- Neural network–based parameter inference for stochastic models
