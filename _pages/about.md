I am a postdoctoral researcher working at the intersection of **mathematical modeling**, **machine learning**, and **quantitative biology**.

My research focuses on **dynamic generative models for biological systems**, with an emphasis on **unbalanced optimal transport**, **flow matching**, and **continuous- and discrete-time probabilistic dynamics**. I am particularly interested in developing theoretically grounded models to describe **cell-state evolution**, **gene expression dynamics**, and **spatial transcriptomic organization**.

A central theme of my work is to bridge **probability flow formulations** (e.g. flow matching, CTMCs, and optimal transport) with **biologically meaningful constraints**, such as cell proliferation, death, and phenotypic plasticity. These methods are motivated by applications in **single-cell RNA-seq**, **perturbation experiments**, and **spatial transcriptomics**, where distributions evolve over time, conditions, or tissue structure.

Methodologically, I am interested in:
- Unbalanced and dynamic optimal transport (e.g. Wasserstein–Fisher–Rao type models)
- Flow-based generative modeling and probability paths
- Discrete and continuous-time Markov processes
- Applications to single-cell and spatial omics data

My long-term goal is to build **principled generative frameworks** that connect mathematical structure with practical biological inference.
